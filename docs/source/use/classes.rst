Usage of Classes
================

In the following sections you find the description of the classes in the PDFReport.
At first there are all the classes which you will need to build the report structure and some abstract
base classes from which the frame classes inherit functionality.

Most of the classes that you need to create a report are set up so that you create an instance of the
class with the parent frame as the first parameter and some more parameters in the constructor.
Then you can set more attributes with functions or attributes.
