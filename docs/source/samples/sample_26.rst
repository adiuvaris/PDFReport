Sample 26
=========

The width of BoxFrames can be defined in percent of the surrounding frame.

This example looks like example 22 but the widths of the BoxFrames are defined in percent.

The first two frames use 60% and 40% of the width. Then there are three columns with a third of the space.
The QR code uses 25%, the image 40% and the text 45% (but limited by the width of the page).

Frames added to a BoxFrame can only use the space of the box, therefore uses the QR-code only the given
space and not the defined 100mm.

To show the effect the same report structure is printed on three pages with different page formats and margins.

Nothing has to be changed on the structure, and it is printed correctly on every page.
