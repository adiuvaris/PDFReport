Sample 25
=========

PageFrames can be used to define that a header or footer should be printed only on certain pages.

Just add multiple PageFrames with different contents to the header or footer container of the report.

In this example there is header for all pages but not the first page and there are two footers on
for odd and one for even pages.

A few manual page breaks has been added to show the effects.
