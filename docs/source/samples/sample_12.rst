Sample 12
=========

This example adds a simple table to the report body. The table has four columns with different alignments.
The widths of the columns are fix and if the text needs more space it will be wrapped.

The first row just below the header shows the widths of the columns.
The header row will be generated by the library based on the title texts for the columns (but it could be suppressed)
