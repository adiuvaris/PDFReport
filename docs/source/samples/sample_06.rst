Sample 06
=========

Here the *NORMAL* text style has been set to font family *Times* and the base size is now 11 points.
Because the other text styles are based on the *NORMAL* style, they use these settings as well.

But it is also possible to adjust only some text styles to use other settings.
In this example the table styles use now *Courier* font family instead of *Times*.
The *FOOTER* style gets a grey text color and the *HEADER* style will be printed in green.

This example shows also how to use color names from the Pillow library.
