Sample 15
=========

In this example the table has five columns, whereas the fourth column would make the table wider than the available width.

Therefore a line break will be automatically added to the third column. The columns four and five are printed on a
second row. To show that an inter-row-space of 1.5mm has been added.

In the example the fourth columns is just a dummy column to show some more structure in the table.

It would be also possible to force a line break after a column programmatically.
