Sample 11
=========

This example prints first a QR code into a rectangle with a width of 50mm and a height of 50mm.
QR codes are squares, so the space will be filled with the QR code.

Then it prints a QR code into a rectangle with a width of 50mm and a height of 80mm.
he code will be centered in the given rectangle. Above and below of the QR code there is some white space.

Next follows a QR code in a rectangle with a width of 100mm and a height of 40mm.
The code will be centered in the given rectangle. Left and right of the QR code there is some white space.

And then a PDF417 code is printed into a rectangle with a width of 50mm and a height of 50mm.
PDF417 codes are rectangles, because of that there is white space above and below the code.

Last it prints a DATAMATRIX code into a rectangle with a width of 50mm and a height of 50mm.
DATAMATRIX codes are squares, so the space will be filled with the code image
