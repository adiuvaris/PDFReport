Sample 20
=========

A BoxFrame is just a rectangular space in the report. It can be filled with any other frame type (e.g. text).

A box with no content wouldn't be visible in the report, because it has no border by default.
To make them visible in this example all boxes have a border.

The first example box has a width of 70mm and a height of 50mm and a thin red border.

The next example box has a width of 150mm and a height of 20mm and a thin red border.
But the pens on the left and right side have been set to 5mm.

The last example box uses the full width of the frame and has a height of 10mm.
It has a special border with different colors and line extents
