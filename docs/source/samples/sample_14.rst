Sample 14
=========

Here the widths of the columns in the table are defined in percent of the full width of the frame.
To do that the values for the width has to be passed as string (the percent sign is not necessary
but it makes the code more readable).

The first row just below the header shows the original widths of the columns.

If the sum of all columns is less the 100 percent (80% in the example), it will use only that part of the frame width.

If it is more than 100 percent ‘line breaks’ will be added (see example about ‘line breaks’ in tables).
