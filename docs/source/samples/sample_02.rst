Sample 02
=========

An instance of a Report is created and the attributes are passed to the report.
Therefore, a PageFormat instance is used to define the page format to ‘Letter’ in landscape mode.
The margins are one inch on the top side and half an inch on all other sides.

To show the printable area a BoxFrame is added to the report body.
The usage of BoxFrames can be found in a later example.
