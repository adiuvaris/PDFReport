Sample 23
=========

In this example a frame is added at a position of 120mm from the left and 50mm from the top of the paper.
The box has a size of 50mm by 70mm. To show the box it has a red border.

Below the box there is a text paragraph.

Then a PositionFrame is added at the position 60mm from the left and 130mm from the top of the paper.
The box has a size of 100mm by 50mm.

The frame cannot be placed on the first (the current) page because there is already a text frame.
Therefore, a page break is inserted automatically and the frame will be printed on the second page
